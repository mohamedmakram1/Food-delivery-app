# Food-delivery-app
This is a small version of food delivery app
The delivery app (wagba) and restaurant admin app are developed in java for course assessment
"mobile programming course", FoE ASU 
With wagba  you can order meals form available restaurants, track you order, and using restaurant Amin app you can accept orders and update 
order status.
I have used firebase database to store orders
